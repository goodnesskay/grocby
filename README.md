## Install

Built and tested with:

* OS X / macOS
* Node 7
* Xcode 8
* Android SDK

A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account is also needed. The security rules for the database must be set to public, since this app doesn't implement authentication. In the [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/console/) under the Database section, Rules tab, change the rules to:

```javascript
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bruz/react-native-redux-groceries.git groceries
cd groceries
npm install
```

Configure:

```bash
cp config.js.example config.js
```

Update config.js with your Firebase app credentials.
